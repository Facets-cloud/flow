# flow upgrade notes — what changed for a running session

## Unreleased

- **Mail reaches you automatically (harness wake).** flow now pushes a
  `[flow-bus wake]` notice into an idle session, and your own hooks surface
  new mail before your next tool call or at turn end. If you armed an inbox
  Monitor loop (`flow inbox pop --wait`), stop it now (TaskStop) and do not
  re-arm it. When a flow-bus notice says mail landed, run `flow inbox pop`
  in the foreground (one-shot), repeat until empty, and act on each.
  Exception: with `FLOW_NO_WAKE=1` set, keep the Monitor recipe in
  references/messaging.md.
- **Codex: run flow commands bare.** Regular Codex sessions run in the
  workspace-write sandbox; flow's exec-policy allow-list (`flow.rules`)
  only matches a bare top-level command. No `VAR=… flow`, no
  `cd … && flow`, no wrapper scripts — otherwise flow fails with
  "readonly database".
- **Upgrade notices.** When flow changes under a running session, the
  next prompt or tool call carries one `[flow-upgrade]` notice pointing
  here. It does not repeat.
